# Introduction

The deployed Webpage is a PassWord Generator that displays the combine use of HTML, CSS, JavaScrip. The application is as simple as clicking on a buton and you will ask questions about the password your are about to create.

URL of the Web page:

# Functionality:

The homework was to update a given Java Script file to give the page functionaliy. There was a starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that we have selected. As an employer with access to secure data I want to be able to create randomly created passwords that meet certain criteria to provide greater security.

*   When the user clicks on the button to generate a password the browser will present a series of prompts with criterias that can/must be selected.

*   The first promt will ask the user of the preffered password length (Between 8-128) and the user needs to enter a number and press "OK"

*   If the user presses "Cancel" the app will tell the user that the password length needs to be defined.

*   If the user enters a number lower than 8 and above 128 the app tells the user that the length must be between 8 and 128.

*   If the number entered us valid, the browser will ask if the user wants the password to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and/or special characters. If all criteria selected correct, than the password will appear in the text box and be exactly how the user wants it to be.

*   If the user does not select any of the criteria the browser will tell the user that at least one criteria must be selected.
